# Pathfinding Project in Swift

## Overview

This project implements a pathfinding solution using Swift, designed for navigating through environments with various complexities, such as obstacles and narrow pathways. The algorithm is capable of finding optimal routes while avoiding obstacles, making it ideal for use in applications like game development, robotics, or any scenario requiring efficient navigation.

## Features

- **Swift-based Pathfinding**: Optimized for performance with native Swift functionality.
- **Collision Detection**: Ensures safe navigation by identifying and avoiding obstacles.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune the algorithmâ€™s behavior to suit different environments.
- **Visualization (if applicable)**: View paths and obstacles directly in the UI.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following:

- Xcode 12 or later
- macOS 10.15 or later
